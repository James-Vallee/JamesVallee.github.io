## Overview

I worked as an **Aerospace Research Intern** within the *Structures and Materials Performance* group at the National Research Council of Canada.
 
My role spanned **multiple independent research projects**, each conducted under different supervisors and focused on distinct aspects of aerospace materials, experimental mechanics, and structural modeling.

The position combined **hands-on experimental testing**, coordination of complex research logistics, and **publication-quality data analysis and documentation**, supporting long-term research initiatives in aircraft structural performance and digital twin development.

## Composite Impact Testing of Carbon Fiber Laminates

This research project focused on the **impact behavior of carbon fiber composite panels** with controlled layup sequences and impact configurations. The objective was to characterize damage initiation and progression under impact loading and to generate experimentally validated datasets suitable for publication.

I supported the **entire experimental lifecycle**, from specimen preparation to post-test inspection and reporting.

### Key Contributions
- Coordinated logistics for composite specimen preparation, machining, fabrication, and testing
- Managed large experimental test matrices involving multiple layup sequences and impact conditions
- Conducted and documented **impact testing** on composite plates
- Supported **non-destructive inspection (NDI)** to assess post-impact damage
- Maintained detailed specimen tracking and test records using structured Excel workflows
- Performed data processing, visualization, and result summarization
- Contributed to the writing of a **published technical research paper**
- Collaborated closely with researchers, technicians, and external suppliers

## High-Temperature Fatigue Testing of Metallic Alloys

In a separate research stream, I supported **high-temperature fatigue testing** of metallic alloys used in aerospace structures. This work was highly hands-on and focused on experimental setup, instrumentation, and monitoring of fatigue and crack growth behavior.

### Key Contributions
- Assisted with **test setup and execution** on MTS mechanical testing systems
- Instrumented specimens using **microwelding** and strain gauge installation
- Conducted **low-cycle fatigue (LCF)** testing under controlled conditions
- Used optical microscopy to measure and track **crack growth**
- Generated and reviewed crack growth reports using **macro-enabled Excel tools**
- Supported data quality assurance and experimental repeatability

## Aircraft Structure Reverse Engineering for Digital Twin Support

This project involved the **reverse engineering of a helicopter rotor blade cross-section** to support digital twin research efforts. The goal was to create an accurate geometric and material representation suitable for downstream structural analysis.

While I did not develop the digital twin itself, my work provided **validated structural inputs** for digital twin modeling efforts.

### Key Contributions
- Digitized and reconstructed rotor blade cross-sections
- Created detailed CAD models using **Autodesk Inventor**
- Assigned material properties, meshing and prepared analysis-ready models in **ANSYS**
- Exported structural data to **NASTRAN-compatible formats**
- Used **VABS** to compute composite section properties
- Documented modeling assumptions, geometry fidelity, and material definitions
