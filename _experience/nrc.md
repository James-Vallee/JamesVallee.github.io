## Overview

I worked as an Aerospace Research Intern within the Structures and Materials Performance group at the National Research Council of Canada. Over the course of a year, I contributed to experimental and analytical research activities supporting aircraft structural performance, materials characterization, and the development of digital twins for aerospace applications.

The role combined hands-on laboratory work, coordination of testing activities, and detailed engineering documentation in a research environment with expectations of publication-quality rigor.

    <h3>Aircraft Structure Reverse Engineering & Digital Twins</h3>
    <p>
      A key component of my work involved reverse engineering aircraft structural components to support the development of digital twins. This included detailed measurement, documentation, and interpretation of structural geometry, material layups, and load paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting models and documentation were used to inform analytical and simulation-based studies aimed at better representing real-world structural behavior in digital environments.

    <h3>Composite & Metallic Materials Testing</h3>
    <p>
      I supported the full testing lifecycle for composite materials and metal alloys, coordinating logistics related to specimen preparation, machining, fabrication, and mechanical testing. This involved working closely with researchers, technicians, and external suppliers to ensure test readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hands-on work included prepreg carbon fiber layups, specimen preparation, and instrumentation for mechanical testing, providing direct exposure to aerospace-grade composite manufacturing and experimental procedures.

    <h3>Mechanical Testing & Experimental Coordination</h3>
    <p>
      I assisted with the execution of mechanical tests, supporting setup, instrumentation, and monitoring of experiments. This work required careful coordination of equipment availability, test scheduling, and adherence to experimental protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this process, I developed an understanding of how experimental constraints, data quality, and repeatability influence the reliability of structural performance assessments.

    <h3>Data Analysis, Documentation & Research Reporting</h3>
    <p>
      Following testing activities, I performed data analysis and contributed to technical documentation and reporting. I worked extensively with <strong>Excel</strong> to process experimental results, generate plots, and summarize findings for internal research use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was conducted with the expectation of publication-quality documentation, reinforcing best practices in data traceability, clarity, and engineering communication within a scientific research context.

    <h3>Composite Impact Testing Research & Technical Paper</h3>
    <p>
      As part of my work at the National Research Council of Canada, I authored a technical research paper focused on impact testing of composite materials. This project investigated the damage mechanisms and structural response of composite laminates subjected to controlled impact loading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work involved defining test objectives, preparing composite specimens, executing impact tests, and analyzing post-impact damage. Emphasis was placed on correlating experimental observations with material behavior and documenting results with publication-level rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was responsible for experimental planning, data analysis, and technical writing, contributing to a structured research document intended for internal review and potential publication.

    <h3>Experimental Methodology & Data Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      The research required careful control of test parameters, specimen preparation, and instrumentation to ensure repeatability and data quality. Impact response, damage initiation, and failure progression were evaluated using a combination of experimental measurements and post-test inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data was processed and visualized using <strong>Excel</strong>, with results presented through plots, tables, and annotated figures suitable for a technical audience. The analysis emphasized clarity, traceability, and consistency with established composite testing standards.
