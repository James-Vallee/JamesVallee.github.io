    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>During my internship at Bombardier Recreational Products, I worked within the Predictive Engineering team, contributing to simulation-driven development and vehicle testing activities across multiple recreational platforms. My role focused on multibody dynamics, data analysis, and validation of simulation models using physical test data, primarily on snowmobiles, three-wheeled vehicles, and four-wheelers.</p>

<p>Much of the work was conducted in a research and development context and is subject to NDA restrictions. As a result, this page focuses on my technical responsibilities, workflow, and engineering approach rather than specific design outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Snowmobile Data Analysis &amp; Duty Cycle Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      The primary project I worked on involved processing and analyzing large volumes of snowmobile test data to support duty cycle development. I developed a data processing tool using <strong>nCode</strong> to clean, organize, and standardize raw test data collected from instrumented vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once processed, the data was used to compile representative duty cycles, which were then optimized using <strong>Altair HyperStudy</strong>. This work involved running parametric studies and evaluating the sensitivity of various inputs to better capture real-world vehicle usage in simulation environments.

    <h3>Suspension Modeling &amp; Bump Steer Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      In parallel, I contributed to a smaller multibody dynamics project focused on suspension behavior for a three-wheeled vehicle platform. This involved editing and refining an existing <strong>Altair MotionView</strong> suspension model to study kinematic behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <strong>HyperStudy</strong>, I performed optimization studies targeting bump steer characteristics, iterating on suspension parameters to evaluate their influence on steering response and compliance. This project strengthened my understanding of suspension kinematics and model-based optimization workflows.

    <h3>Vehicle Testing &amp; Instrumentation Support</h3>
    <p>
      I also supported on-site vehicle testing sessions for four-wheeler platforms, working closely with test engineers during data collection activities. My responsibilities included assisting with instrumentation setup, sensor installation, and validation of recorded signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      After testing, I helped review and compare physical test data against simulation results, contributing to the broader validation effort between predictive models and real-world behavior.

    <h3>Vibration &amp; Frequency Analysis for Accessories</h3>
    <p>
      Another project involved performing vibration and frequency analysis to support the specification of snowmobile accessories. I analyzed test and simulation data to identify relevant frequency ranges and summarize results for engineering evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work relied heavily on <strong>Excel</strong> for data manipulation and visualization, reinforcing my ability to communicate complex dynamic behavior through clear and structured technical summaries.

<h2 id="tools--engineering-skills">Tools &amp; Engineering Skills</h2>

<p>Throughout the internship, I worked extensively with multibody simulation, optimization, and data analysis tools, including Altair MotionView, HyperStudy, nCode, Excel, and basic CAD editing in CATIA. The role emphasized connecting simulation outputs with physical test data and applying analytical thinking to real-world vehicle dynamics problems.</p>
