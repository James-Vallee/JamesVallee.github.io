    <p class="overview-intro">
      This project involved the design and manufacturing of a carbon fiber nose cone for a Formula SAE vehicle.
      The focus was on achieving accurate fitment with the chassis and impact attenuator while producing a
      lightweight component with a high-quality surface finish.
    </p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Design a nose cone with precise integration to the frame and impact attenuator</li>
      <li>Develop a manufacturable composite process using a CNC foam plug mold</li>
      <li>Achieve a smooth, visually clean carbon fiber exterior</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Surfacing & Mold Design</h2>
    <p>
      The nose cone geometry was surfaced in <strong>SolidWorks</strong>, with emphasis on smooth curvature
      transitions to promote good fiber drapability and a clean final appearance.
      Fitment to the chassis and impact attenuator was carefully controlled through reference geometry.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Surface modeling used to ensure continuous curvature</li>
      <li>Interfaces designed for accurate alignment with surrounding structures</li>
      <li>Draft angles incorporated to facilitate mold release</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Composite Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>
      A plug mold was manufactured from 4-inch-thick <strong>CNC-machined foam blocks</strong>,
      bonded together to form the full mold geometry.
      The nose cone was produced using a wet layup process over the foam plug.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>2×2 twill weave carbon fiber selected for improved drapability</li>
      <li>Wet layup with resin application</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This project did not include CFD or FEA analysis, as the primary goal was to validate
      the manufacturing approach, fitment, and surface quality rather than aerodynamic performance.

    <h2>Post-Processing & Final Finish</h2>
    <p>
      After curing and demolding, the nose cone underwent post-processing to improve surface quality
      and seal any dry spots in the laminate.
      The final finish was achieved through sanding and clear coating.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Surface sanding to remove imperfections</li>
      <li>Clear coat applied for sealing and gloss finish</li>
      <li>Final fit check performed on the vehicle</li>
    </ul>
