      This project focused on the redesign of the Formula SAE wheel centers with the objective of 
      reducing unsprung mass while maintaining durability under fatigue loading. 
      The components were fully redesigned, analyzed, and validated through simulation 
      before release for manufacturing.
    </p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce wheel center mass relative to the previous design</li>
      <li>Maintain stresses below the fatigue endurance limit</li>
      <li>Ensure CNC manufacturability and practical tolerancing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design & Weight Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      The wheel centers were modeled in <strong>SolidWorks</strong> and iteratively refined to remove 
      non-load-bearing material while preserving stiffness in critical load paths.
      Geometry changes were driven directly by simulation results rather than aesthetic constraints.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Front wheel center mass reduced by <strong>24%</strong></li>
      <li>Rear wheel center mass reduced by <strong>29%</strong></li>
      <li>Material removal focused on low-stress regions identified through FEA</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Finite Element Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Structural analysis was performed in <strong>ANSYS Mechanical</strong> to evaluate stress distribution
      under representative loading conditions. The design was optimized to ensure that peak stresses
      remained below the material fatigue limit with appropriate safety margin.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Static stress evaluation used to guide geometry refinement</li>
      <li>Stress concentrations identified and reduced through fillet and profile changes</li>
      <li>Final design validated against fatigue-related stress thresholds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design for Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>
      The final design was developed with <strong>CNC manufacturability</strong> in mind.
      Features were constrained to realistic tooling access, fillet radii, and machining setups
      to ensure the part could be produced without excessive cost or complexity.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tool access and minimum internal radii considered during design</li>
      <li>Uniform wall thickness prioritized where possible</li>
      <li>Tolerances defined to balance performance and manufacturability</li>
    </ul>
